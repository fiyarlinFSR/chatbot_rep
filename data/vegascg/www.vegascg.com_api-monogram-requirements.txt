API Monogram Program & APIQR Requirements

API Monogram is designed to facilitate the consistent manufacturing of product that conforms to applicable API Specifications.
Once the license gets implemented, it maintains and continually improves the quality management system to meet the requirements of API Spec Q1, even the Q1 certification is not required.
Licensed manufacturers can make use of this opportunity to conform their product standards so that it is easily identifiable, traceable even from the date of manufacture.
Licenses can only be issued, only after the verification and conformance of an on-site audit to verify product specifications and management system requirements.
Based on renewal, audits will be confirmed and performed periodically either once in every three years, or on an annual basis depending upon the management system registration through the APIQR Program.
Licensees, licensed products and licensing statuses are provided in the online API Composite List.
