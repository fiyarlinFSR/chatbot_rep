Ultrasonic Thickness Measurement (UTT) Testing
Ultrasonic Thickness Measurement (UTT) Testing is a NDT method used to inspect the metal thickness of ship hulls, piping, and structural steel. An Ultrasonic Thickness Gauge is a measuring instrument for the non-destructive investigation of a material’s thickness using ultrasonic waves. The usage of Ultrasonic Thickness Gauge for non-destructive testing to check material properties such as thickness measurement and internal defects.
In the field of industrial Ultrasonic Testing, Ultrasonic Thickness Measurement (UTM) is frequently used to characterize material thickness, integrity, or other physical properties by means of high-frequency sound waves. It is widely used for product testing and quality control of steel structures and components.
Vegas Consulting is capable of measuring the remaining wall thickness of metal pipes, tanks, structural parts, and pressure vessels that are subject to internal corrosion and erosion that cannot be seen from the outside. Detection of metal loss caused by corrosion, erosion or damage is vital to ensure the continued safety and operation of the inspected structures.
Ultrasonic Thickness Measurement Testing can be obtained when the vessel is in or out of operation (pre-docking or dry-docking) and is performed by qualified inspectors. Preparation of accurate and reliable report based on information from measurements, which further used for designing and budgeting repair works.
