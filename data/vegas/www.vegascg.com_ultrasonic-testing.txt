Ultrasonic Testing (UT)
Ultrasonic Testing (UT) is a non-destructive test method for detecting material defects using ultrasound technology. Ultrasonic testing is a volumetric testing method, similar to radiographic testing. The volume is tested for irregularities. It can also be used to determine a material’s thickness, such as measuring the wall thickness of a pipe.
Ultrasonic Testing Service is recognized for having the highest depth of penetration to detect subsurface flaws. Our sophisticated Ultrasonic Testing equipment is highly accurate in determining flaw position and estimating size and shape. In most cases, it is only necessary to have one-side access and our technicians have the ability to evaluate with immediate results. In addition to Ultrasonic Testing (UT), Vegas offers ultrasonic thickness testing and phased array testing which are more specialized types of ultrasonic NDT testing.
Ultrasonic Testing Can Be Used for Multiple Inspection Methods

Volumetric inspections of, Welds, Castings, Products, etc.
Detection of planar discontinuities in pipes
For general wall thickness measurements
For standard and specified periodical industrial inspections of Machines, Equipment, Engines, Turbines, Aircrafts, etc.
For periodical and non-periodical industrial inspections at power stations; including boilers, vessels, drums, and pipelines
For periodical and non-periodical industrial inspections in the oil and gas industry; including reactors, pipelines, storage tanks, heat exchangers, etc.
For periodical and non-periodical industrial inspections in the chemical industry; including pumps, and chemical storage
Public Transport; Trains, Ships, Buses, and Trams
Constructions including Bridges, Oil platforms, And Windmills

We at Vegas uses advanced Ultrasonic Testing Equipment and we can inspect the customer components and structures to industry codes, standards or customer specifications, ensuring that your components and structures meet the highest standards for safety and reliability. We offer both laboratory and on-site Ultrasonic Testing Services.

Vegas Ultrasonic Thickness Measurement & Capabilities
We uses Ultrasonic Testing for the detection and sizing of in-service and manufacture defects. Ultrasonic Testing can be used for weld seam testing, sheet metal testing and wall thickness measurement, as well as testing large-volume forgings or casings. The Ultrasonic Testing also provides path length measurement, surface velocity measurement and crack depth measurement.
Our experts provide highly accurate defect coordinates, length and orientation height (depth). Planar flaws are considered to be more detrimental to weld quality than volumetric flaws. Ultrasonic Testing has a higher probability than radiography of detecting defects, consistently rejecting planar discontinuities.
Vegas Ultrasonic Testing Experts are certified in accordance with ISO 9712, PCN or NAS 410 / EN 1479 Level 2 and 3 qualified. Our Ultrasonic Testing Services meet all the latest testing standards. We also provide customers with dedicated data evaluation software packages for the evaluation of Ultrasonic Testing Data (Ultrasonic Testing Signal and Coordinates).
All Ultrasonic Testing Inspection Services are executed in compliance with industry codes and standards such as ASME, API, and AWS. Please contact us with any other questions or concerns regarding Ultrasonic Testing Services.
